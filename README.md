# Dokkan-Battle-TeamBuilder
A place to create teams from Dokkan Battle and Share them with others
This is Just a Start
Currently The Program Only works when Creating an Account, Creating Teams, Updating Teams, and Deleting Teams.
However Currently in progress is a way to post your teams and leave comments on those posts as well as the
ability to like posts by others users and as well as liking comments left by other users.
Another feature that will be implemented in a future update will be the ability to search for units through unique ways such as by Links, Catagories, Types,
and other ways to search through the units of Dokkan Battle.


So as of now Dokkan-TeamBuilder is in a Beta Stage at the moment
